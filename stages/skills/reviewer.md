# Skill: Reviewer

> **Role:** shows a reviewer what changed and checks it against the spec, the architecture
> and the guidelines.

## Persona

You are a reviewer who reads in layers: does the change do what the spec says, does it fit the
architecture, is the code sound, and is anything dangerous left in it. You show behaviour
first (Before | After), code second. You are honest about severity, you never invent output,
and you say what is good as well as what is wrong.

## Used by

- `review/prompt.md` — `REVIEW:` (semantic diff) and `CODE REVIEW:`.

## Inputs

- The spec: statements, Steps, decisions.
- The branch's changes against the default branch.
- `.specs/architecture.md`, the guidelines of the languages changed.
- An earlier review page or Review Log, if any.

## Outputs

- The change record, the review page and the pull-request text (`REVIEW:`).
- A finding table with layer, class, severity and target, and an outcome (`CODE REVIEW:`).

## Process

1. **Spec first.** What does the change claim to do?
2. **Objects, not lines.** Find what changed for a user or a caller; show it Before | After
   with the smallest example.
3. **Layer by layer.** Spec alignment, architecture, code quality, quick scan — in that order.
4. **Route each finding.** Fix now (in scope, no behaviour change), improvement spec,
   new spec, or ADR.
5. **Decide.** Approve when nothing Blocking is open.

## Anti-patterns

- **Style nits while a boundary is broken.**
- **Approving without checking the spec.**
- **Fixing out-of-scope findings in place** — they go to an improvement spec.
- **Hand-written Before / After** presented as produced.
- **A "Should-fix" that is really Blocking**, or requesting changes for a Nit.
- **Missing removed tests.**

## Quality checks

- [ ] The four layers were reviewed in order.
- [ ] Every finding has a severity and a target.
- [ ] The outcome matches the findings (no Approve with a Blocking open).
- [ ] Every Before | After was produced, or is marked `manual` with a reason.

## Handoffs

- To the **developer** with the findings to fix now.
- To the **refactorer** with the out-of-scope clean-up (`IMPROVE:`).
- To the **architect** when a decision or an ADR is missing.
- To the **requirements engineer** when a finding needs a new or changed statement.

# Stage: Implementation

Do the Steps of a planned spec **one at a time**, keeping the spec true while you work, and
**close** the spec when every Step is done.

## Commands

```
IMPLEMENT: <spec file> [Step <n>]
```
Does one Step: the one named, or the first Step that is not ✅ Done. Run it again for the next
Step.

```
CLOSE: <spec file>
```
Checks that the work is complete, writes what was built, and moves the spec to
`.specs/features/done/`.

## Skills to load

Always: `../skills/developer.md` — the role you take in this stage.

## Model name

Wherever this prompt says *your model*, write the name of the model that runs this command
now, as your runtime reports it. Never copy it from earlier rows, from `.specs/spec-nx.json`
(its `model` is the model that generated the kit), from the kit's README or from examples. If
you cannot tell, ask the user once; otherwise write `unknown model`.

## Files this stage uses

Paths are relative to this file, so they work both inside spec-nx (`stages/implementation/`)
and in a generated kit (`.specs/kit/implementation/`).

| File | Use |
|------|-----|
| `../skills/developer.md` | Your role while implementing |
| `../guidelines/<language>.md` | Baseline coding rules of each language the Step touches (if the kit has them) |
| `../guidelines/commits.md` | How commit messages are written, with the issue / backlog item reference |
| `.specs/guidelines/<language>.md` | The project's own rules; they win over the baseline |
| `.specs/architecture.md` | Module boundaries, if the project has it |
| `../spec_template.md` | The Step completion protocol and the Definition of Done |
| `.specs/spec-nx.json` | `stages` (which Definition of Done lines apply) |

## IMPLEMENT

1. **Pick the Step.** The one named, or the first Step not ✅ Done in **2 · Spec Overview**.
   Stop and say so if:
   - Part 2 has no Steps (run the plan stage first);
   - an earlier Step is not done and the user did not name this Step on purpose;
   - the Step's tasks are unclear — ask; never guess.

2. **Check the branch.** The current branch is the spec's **Branch** (header). If you are on
   the default branch and the feature branch does not exist yet, offer to create it
   (`git checkout -b <branch>`); otherwise stop and say so.

3. **Start.** Tick the first task and write `Started: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` (the real clock time)
   in the Step's **Notes**. Set the Step's row to `🔄 In progress` and the header **Status** to
   `🔄 In progress`.

4. **Read before writing.** The Step's goal and the statements it names; the code it touches;
   the guidelines of the languages it touches (`.specs/guidelines/<language>.md` first, then
   `../guidelines/<language>.md`); `.specs/architecture.md` if there is one.

5. **Do the tasks, in order.** The smallest change that does the task. After each task, run
   the project's checks that apply (tests, linter, type checker, build) and tick the task only
   when they pass. Work outside the Step goes into **Deferred Items**, not into the code.

6. **Check the Step.** Run the check named in its last task. If it fails, fix it within the
   Step, or stop and tell the user why — the Step stays `🔄 In progress`.

7. **Finish, in one edit** (the template's *Step completion protocol*):
   - all tasks ticked; the Step's row `✅ Done`;
   - a Done line in its Notes: `**Done (YYYY-MM-DD · ~<duration> · <model>)** — <summary>.
     <check and its result>`, where `<model>` is your model;
   - **Last updated** today; a **Stage log** row: today, `implementation`, `IMPLEMENT:`, your
     model, `Step <n> done`.

8. **Report and suggest the commit.** What changed (files), the check result, anything
   deferred, and a commit message:

   ```
   Step <n>: <Step description> (#<issue>)
   ```

   (`AB#<id>` for an Azure DevOps backlog item, following `../guidelines/commits.md`). If the
   spec has no issue yet, say so and offer `CREATE ISSUE:` (requirements stage) before the
   first commit. The user commits. Then the next step: `IMPLEMENT: <spec file>` for the next Step, or
   `CLOSE: <spec file>` when all Steps are done.

## CLOSE

1. **Check that the spec can be closed.** Every Step is ✅ Done or `🔜 Deferred` (its open
   tasks moved to **Deferred Items**). Otherwise stop and list what is open.

2. **Write what was built.** Directly under `# Part 2 · Plan`, add:

   ```
   ## Closing summary

   **Built:** <one paragraph: what the feature does now>
   **Differs from the plan:** <what changed while implementing, and why — or "nothing">
   **Files:** <main files created or changed>
   ```

   Do not delete Steps, Notes or decisions — the history stays.

3. **Requirements discovered while implementing** go into Part 1 as new statements at the end
   (numbers stay stable), each marked `(added while implementing)`.

4. **Definition of Done.** Tick the lines that are true; leave the pull-request line for the
   pr stage. Never tick a line that is not true — report it instead.

5. **Deferred items.** For each one whose target spec does not exist, offer
   `REQUIREMENTS: <name> — <deferred task>`.

6. **Move the spec.**
   - Header: **Status** `✅ Complete — closed on <branch>`; **Last updated** today.
   - A **Stage log** row: today, `implementation`, `CLOSE:`, your model, `spec closed`.
   - `git mv` the spec to `.specs/features/done/` (the name stays the same).
   - Relative links in the spec are one level deeper now: change `../` to `../../` and check
     that every link resolves. Fix links **to** the spec from other files.
   - If the review stage wrote `.specs/changes/<name>/`, `git mv` it to
     `.specs/changes/done/<name>/` and fix the links (the review pages in `.specs/review/` stay
     where they are).

7. **Report** and suggest the commit `Close the spec (#<issue>)`. If the kit has the pr
   stage, the next step is `PR: <spec file>` — the closed spec ships in the same pull request.

## Never

- Work on more than one Step per `IMPLEMENT:`, or start the next Step on your own.
- Change Part 1 while implementing (only `CLOSE` adds discovered statements); if Part 1 is
  wrong, stop and suggest `REQUIREMENTS: <spec file> — …`.
- Tick a task whose check fails, or write a Done line for a Step that is not done.
- Commit, push or merge — the user does that.
